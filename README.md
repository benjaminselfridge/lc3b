# lc3b

An instruction-level assembler/simulator for the LC-3b ISA.

This project is incomplete.

## Current plan

Simulator and assembler are both nominally complete; next up is infrastructure stuff:
  - Test suite (assembler & simulator)
  - Command line interfaces for both assembler and simulator
