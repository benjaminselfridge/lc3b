# lc3b

An instruction-level assembler/simulator for the LC-3b ISA.

This project is incomplete

## Current plan

The simulator is finished; almost surely buggy. Working on the assembler right
now so I can develop a test suite for the simulation. Need to develop a test
suite for the assembler as well.
